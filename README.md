# SQL Data Analytics Project

A comprehensive data analytics project with data exploration, analysis and reporting. It is divided into 2 parts: 

**1. Exploratory Data Analysis - EDA** (scripts 1-6)    
**2. Advanced Analytics** (scripts 7-13).

The project is performed in **PostgreSQL**, adapted from a MS SQL Server course. 
Designed as a portfolio project which highlights industry best practices in data analytics.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

### Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed an initial investigation of the dataset to summarize its main characteristics and identify patterns:
- **Database Exploration**
- **Dimensions Exploration**
- **Date Exploration**
- **Measures Exploration**
- **Ranking Analysis (Top N / Bottom N).**

**Key Techniques Used:** `JOINS`, `UNION ALL`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, Aggregate Functions and Window Functions (`DENSE_RANK()`).

### Part 2: Advanced Analytics
Conducted a deeper analysis to solve complex business problems and derive actionable insights:
- **Change Over Time**
- **Cumulative Analysis**
- **Performance Analysis**
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis**
- **Data Segmentation**
- **Reporting.**

**Key Techniques Used:** CTEs, Subqueries, Window Functions (`LAG()`, `AVG() OVER()`), `CASE` statements, and creating **2 analytical `Views`** for simplified reporting.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **DBMS:** PostgreSQL
- **IDE**: DBeaver
- **Key Concepts:** Advanced SQL Analytics, Query Optimization
